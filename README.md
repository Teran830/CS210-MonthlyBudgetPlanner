# CS210-MonthlyBudMonthly Budget Growth Planner
Project Summary
This project is a C++ console application that calculates monthly savings growth using user-defined income, expenses, time duration, and an annual interest rate. The program uses a menu-driven interface and applies monthly compounding interest to project savings over time. The goal of this project was to simulate realistic financial planning while applying object-oriented programming principles, input validation, and structured program design.
What Problem It Solves
The program helps users understand how consistent monthly savings combined with compound interest can impact long-term financial growth. It demonstrates how small financial decisions accumulate over time.
What I Did Well
I structured the program using modular functions to improve clarity and maintainability. I implemented input validation to prevent invalid data and designed a clear menu system for user interaction. The financial calculations are organized and formatted for readability.
Areas for Improvement
The project could be improved by incorporating file input/output, implementing classes to encapsulate financial data, and adding more advanced error handling. Expanding the program to support graphical output or exporting reports would also enhance functionality.
Most Challenging Component
The most challenging part was implementing monthly compounding interest correctly while maintaining accurate formatting. I resolved this by breaking the logic into smaller steps and testing multiple scenarios to verify calculations.
Transferable Skills
This project strengthened my ability to:
•	Design structured, menu-driven programs
•	Apply compound interest formulas in software
•	Validate and sanitize user input
•	Format console output professionally
•	Debug logical and mathematical errors
These skills directly apply to future coursework and real-world software development.
Maintainability and Readability
The code is organized into clearly named functions with consistent formatting and descriptive variable names. Logical separation of concerns improves maintainability and makes future modifications straightforward.
